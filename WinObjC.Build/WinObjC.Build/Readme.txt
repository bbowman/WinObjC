Welcome to the Windows Bridge for iOS project preview

The Windows Bridge for iOS (also referred to as WinObjC) is a Microsoft open-source project that provides an Objective-C
development environment for Visual Studio and support for iOS APIs. The bridge allows you to create 
Universal Windows Platform (UWP) apps that will run on many Windows devices using iOS APIs and Objective-C code alongside 
Windows 10 features like Cortana and Live Tiles.
